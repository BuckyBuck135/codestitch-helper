### MAJOR RELEASE - Framework Separation Architecture for Astro Support

**New Features:**

**Breaking Changes:**
- Command IDs have been renamed with framework prefixes:
  - `codestitchHelper.replaceNavTabs` → `codestitchHelper.eleventy.replaceNavTabs`
  - `codestitchHelper.optimizeSharpImages` → `codestitchHelper.eleventy.optimizeImages`
  - `codestitchHelper.setupEleventySharpImages` → `codestitchHelper.eleventy.setupSharpImages`
  - `codestitchHelper.optimizeAstroImages` → `codestitchHelper.astro.optimizeImages`

**Performance Improvements:**

**Other Changes:**
- All files renamed to camelCase convention
- Added `bugs` URL for issue reporting
